# Advanced Calculator

## Overview

The **Advanced Calculator** is a comprehensive Python-based application designed to handle basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced mathematical calculations. The calculator includes features such as equation solving, graph plotting, complex number operations, random number generation, currency conversion, and more. Built using popular Python libraries like `math`, `sympy`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`, the tool offers a user-friendly experience with interactive inputs.

## Features

### Basic Operations:
- **Addition (`+`)**
- **Subtraction (`-`)**
- **Multiplication (`*`)**
- **Division (`/`)**
- **Floor Division (`//`)**
- **Modulo (`%`)**
- **Exponentiation (`**`)**

### Advanced Mathematical Functions:
- **Square Root (`sqrt`)**
- **Logarithms (Base 10) (`log`)**
- **Trigonometric Functions**:
  - Sine (`sin`)
  - Cosine (`cos`)
  - Tangent (`tan`)
- **Factorial (`fact`)**

### Additional Features:
- **Random Number Generator (`rand`)**: Generates random numbers within a specified range.
- **Equation Solver (`eqn`)**: Solve algebraic equations using `sympy`. (e.g., `2*x + 5 = 0`)
- **Currency Converter (`conv`)**: Convert between USD, EUR, INR, and GBP.
- **Graph Plotting (`plot`)**: Plot a sine wave graph using `matplotlib`.
- **Complex Number Operations (`complex`)**: Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers.

### Memory & History:
- **Memory**: Store the result of the last calculation and reuse it in subsequent operations.
- **History**: View the calculation history for reference.
